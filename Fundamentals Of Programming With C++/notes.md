# Notes
- <iostream> => library to handle input and output
- std => standard character output
- << => bitwise shift left 
- "hi" => string literal
- overloading is a from of polymorphism
- `app.css` => source file that includes source code
- `#include <iostream>` => a preprocessor statement
- `#include` => a preprocessor directive used for file inclusion 
- `main function` => the entry point
-  Directives in the source file tell the preprocessor to take specific actions. 
-  `identifier` => unique name
-  `variable` => data container with an identifier
